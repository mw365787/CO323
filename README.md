# CO323
This assignment consisted of 3 tasks:

1) A simple form with information to put in. Different type of inputs and 
   JavaScript functions for form handling. After button click, the information is
   being transferred to style table with reset button available.
   
2) This task required to create a simple interface that allows you to input
    a number. That input will display a number of differently colored blocks,
    each of them spaced twice the distance from previous one.
    
3) The last task was to create a 'Tic-tac-toe' game.
    It was challenging and very engaging. Initially, I had problems
    with winning condition implementation but I came up with neat and 
    easy solution. (see the code comments in question3.js file).
    However, the design is not very responsive but I feel very proud that
    my first approach to JavaScript was successful.
